# Multiclass-Image-Classifier
Inspired by an episode (S04E04) on the popular comedy TV series, Silicon Valley (HBO), initially I decided to built a desi version of the Binary Classifier (similar to the show which built a Hot Dog or Not a Hot Dog) - Vada Pav or Not a Vada Pav. I trained a Convolutional Neural Network model on a dataset built from images of Vada Pav and Burger, where the output was binary classification of test data (1-Vada Pav/ 0-Not A Vada Pav). Eventually, to learn about Multi-class Classification, I decided to abstract on this project. I decided to include 3 classes of images, Vada Pav, Burger and Sandwiches. And the result would entail correctly labelling the test day as one of these 3 categories.
